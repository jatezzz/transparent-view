# Transparent Window Project

## Overview

The Transparent Window Project is a macOS application designed to provide a transparent, draggable window that can overlay any other window. This is particularly useful for developers and designers who need to check pixel-perfect implementations of their designs. By using images exported from design tools like Figma, you can ensure that your implementation matches the design accurately. This project offers similar functionality to Zeplin's floating window, allowing for adjustable transparency and easy repositioning.

## Features

- **Transparent Window**: The window is fully transparent, making it easy to overlay on any application.
- **Adjustable Transparency**: Use the slider to adjust the transparency of the window and the image it contains.
- **Draggable Window**: Click and drag anywhere within the window to reposition it on your screen.
- **Image Overlay**: Import images from Figma or other design tools to compare with your application's UI for pixel-perfect implementation.
- **Resizable Window**: The window automatically resizes to fit the dimensions of the imported image.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS 10.15 or later
- Xcode 12 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/transparent-window.git
    cd transparent-window
    ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
    ```bash
    open Transparent.xcodeproj
    ```

3. Build and run the project in Xcode.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Use the "Select Image" button to choose an image file (PNG, JPG, or JPEG) exported from Figma or another design tool.
3. Adjust the transparency using the slider to see your design overlaid on your application.
4. Drag the window to reposition it as needed.

### Figma export
The main purpose of the project is to beused for Figma's designs, so you just need to export your whole screen into a image faile and imported into the Transparent project.
